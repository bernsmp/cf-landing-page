## 1. The Zoom Lens Diagnostic
**Pattern by Bill Belichick** — New England Patriots

```
I want to develop my ability to see patterns at multiple levels simultaneously.

Here's a situation/project/problem I'm currently working on:
[PASTE YOUR SITUATION]

Analyze this at three distinct levels:

1. MICRO LEVEL: What specific details, behaviors, or data points am I likely overlooking? What would someone obsessively detail-oriented notice that I'm missing?

2. MACRO LEVEL: What does this situation reveal about the underlying system, mental model, or decision-making pattern at play? What would a strategist see when they zoom out?

3. THE CONNECTION: What insight emerges only when you hold both levels in mind simultaneously? What does the micro tell us about the macro, and vice versa?

Then give me one specific question I should be asking that I'm probably not asking.

<output_guidance>
Be clinical and precise. No fluff, no cheerleading.

Example of the altitude shift I'm looking for:
- MICRO: "The left tackle shifts his weight 0.3 seconds before run plays"
- MACRO: "This reveals the offensive coordinator doesn't trust the line in pass protection"
- CONNECTION: "Target the tackle on play-action—he'll telegraph the fake"

Each level should feel like a different lens on the same situation, not three generic observations.
</output_guidance>

## 2. The Mirror Technique
**Pattern by Gregg Popovich** — San Antonio Spurs

```
I need to give someone feedback, but I want to do it in a way that bypasses defensiveness and creates genuine reflection.

Here's the situation:
[DESCRIBE THE BEHAVIOR OR DECISION YOU NEED TO ADDRESS]

Help me:

1. DESCRIBE OBJECTIVELY: Rewrite this situation as pure observation—what a camera would have recorded—with zero evaluative language.

2. THE QUESTION: Give me one question that will help this person see their own behavior as if watching someone else do it.

3. THE STANDARD: Articulate the principle at stake in a way that applies to everyone equally, not just this person.

4. THE DELIVERY: How do I present this so the person feels I'm holding up a mirror, not swinging a hammer?

<calibration>
EVALUATIVE (avoid): "You made a bad decision by not including the team"
OBSERVATIONAL (target): "The decision was announced Monday. The team learned about it Tuesday via email. No one was consulted beforehand."

The observation should make the evaluation obvious without stating it. If I have to add "which was wrong," I haven't described it precisely enough.

Keep the question short. Pop doesn't give speeches—he asks one question and waits.
</calibration>
```

## 3. The Hidden Asset Audit
**Pattern by Jay Abraham** — Marketing Strategist

```
I want to find the hidden multipliers in my business—the assets and opportunities I'm walking past every day.

Here's my business situation:
[DESCRIBE YOUR BUSINESS, WHAT YOU OFFER, AND YOUR CURRENT CHALLENGES]

Help me identify:

1. HIDDEN ASSETS: What capabilities, processes, relationships, or intellectual property might I have that could be packaged, licensed, or leveraged differently?

2. UNDERPRICED VALUE: Where am I giving away expertise, access, or results that others would pay premium prices for?

3. PATTERN TRANSFER: What successful patterns from completely different industries might apply to my situation?

4. THE THREE MULTIPLIERS: Looking through Jay's lens (more customers, higher transaction value, more frequent transactions)—which lever am I ignoring?

<output_guidance>
Think like Jay: the gold is already in the building. Don't suggest I acquire new things—find what I already have that I'm undervaluing.

For each hidden asset you identify, show me:
- What it currently IS (how I probably see it)
- What it could BE (how to reframe it)
- One specific action to test the reframe

Example pattern transfer format:
"A furniture store tested 33 greetings and found one that tripled sales. In your business, the equivalent test would be: [specific application]"

Be specific. "You could monetize your expertise" is too vague. "Your onboarding process could become a $2,000 course for competitors" is specific.
</output_guidance>
```

## 4. The Direct Line Diagnostic
**Pattern by Ursula Burns** — Former CEO, Xerox

```
I want to get better at cutting through fog and saying what needs to be said.

Here's a situation where I sense something isn't being addressed:
[DESCRIBE THE MEETING, CONVERSATION, OR ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMIC]

Help me:

1. NAME THE UNSPOKEN: What's the thing everyone probably knows but no one is saying? What's the elephant?

2. THE DIRECT QUESTION: Give me one question I could ask that would cut through the dancing-around and get to the real issue.

3. THE STAKES: What's the cost of continuing to not say this thing? What does ongoing avoidance enable?

4. THE DELIVERY: How do I say this directly without being harsh?

<calibration>
The spectrum I'm navigating:
- TOO VAGUE: "I think we should revisit our approach"
- TOO HARSH: "This project is failing and everyone knows it"
- DIRECT LINE: "We're six weeks behind and no one has said it out loud. What's the actual path to launch?"

Direct ≠ harsh. Direct = clear about what's true without unnecessary softening OR unnecessary edge.

The question in section 2 should be short. Under 15 words. Burns didn't give speeches—she asked the one question that cracked things open.
</calibration>
```

## 5. Reading the Leading Edge
**Pattern by John Wooden** — UCLA Basketball

```
I want to get better at sensing what's happening beneath the surface—catching problems before they show up in results.

Here's a person or situation I'm trying to read:
[DESCRIBE THE PERSON, TEAM, OR SITUATION]

Help me identify:

1. LEADING INDICATORS: What early warning signs should I watch for? What behaviors or signals typically precede problems in situations like this?

2. THE TELL BEFORE THE TELL: If something is off but hasn't surfaced yet, where would it show up first? What would I notice if I stopped watching outcomes and started watching process?

3. THE QUESTION THEY'RE NOT ASKING: What might this person be dealing with that they haven't admitted to themselves yet?

4. MY BLIND SPOT: What invisible load might I be carrying into this situation that's affecting what I can see?

<output_guidance>
Wooden watched feet, not the ball. He noticed the quarter-inch drag before the missed shot.

For each indicator you identify:
- What specifically to observe (behavior, not outcome)
- What it might signal
- How early this shows up before results reflect it

Example format:
"Watch for: Response time to messages increasing from hours to days
Signals: Cognitive overload or disengagement
Lead time: Usually visible 2-3 weeks before missed deadlines"

Be specific. "Watch for signs of stress" is too vague. "Watch for whether they're asking questions in meetings or staying silent" is observable.
</output_guidance>

## 6. Building Shared Consciousness
**Pattern by General Stanley McChrystal** — Joint Special Operations Command

```
I want to create better information flow so my team/organization can move faster and make better decisions without bottlenecks.

Here's my current situation:
[DESCRIBE YOUR TEAM, ORGANIZATION, OR PROJECT]

Help me design:

1. THE DAILY PICTURE: What information does everyone need to see regularly to make good decisions independently? What's the minimum viable shared consciousness for my context?

2. THE BOTTLENECKS: Where is information currently getting stuck? What decisions are waiting on approval that shouldn't need to?

3. THE RITUAL: What recurring meeting, communication, or system would ensure everyone has the same picture?

4. THE DISCOMFORT TEST: McChrystal said to "decentralize until it makes you uncomfortable." What would I have to share or delegate that currently feels risky?

<output_guidance>
McChrystal's insight: information is like milk, not gold. It spoils if hoarded.

For THE RITUAL, give me something specific and implementable:
- Format (standup, shared doc, dashboard, etc.)
- Frequency (daily, weekly, etc.)
- What exactly gets shared
- Time investment required

For THE DISCOMFORT TEST, name the specific thing—not "more transparency" but "sharing the client pipeline with the whole team" or "letting project leads approve budgets under $5K without sign-off."

If something feels risky to share, explain WHY it feels risky and what would need to be true for the risk to be acceptable.
</output_guidance>

## 7. The Timescale Shift
**Pattern by Indra Nooyi** — Former CEO, PepsiCo

```
I want to think more strategically by operating on a longer timescale than my environment is pushing me toward.

Here's a decision or situation I'm facing:
[DESCRIBE YOUR SITUATION]

Analyze this across multiple timescales:

1. THE DEFAULT TIMESCALE: What time horizon is my environment implicitly pushing me toward? What's the "obvious" decision on that timescale?

2. THE DOUBLED TIMESCALE: If I doubled the time horizon, what changes? What becomes important that wasn't? What becomes irrelevant?

3. THE SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS: What decision would look smart this quarter but damage me in five years? What looks costly now but compounds?

4. THE NOOYI TEST: What's something I could do with zero immediate ROI that would build long-term leverage, trust, or positioning?

<calibration>
Example of the shift:
DEFAULT (this quarter): "Cut the training budget—immediate savings"
DOUBLED (2 years): "The savings disappear into hiring costs when skilled people leave"
SECOND-ORDER (5 years): "Reputation as a company that doesn't invest in people = harder to recruit"
NOOYI TEST: "Write personal letters to team members' families thanking them"

The Nooyi Test answer should feel almost uncomfortably long-term. If it has obvious immediate ROI, it's not the Nooyi move.
</calibration>
```

## 8. Designing Your Braintrust
**Pattern by Ed Catmull** — Co-founder, Pixar

```
I want to create conditions where I can get genuinely honest feedback without defensiveness (mine or others').

Here's what I need feedback on:
[DESCRIBE YOUR PROJECT, IDEA, OR DECISION]

Help me design a feedback process:

1. THE RIGHT PEOPLE: Who should be in my Braintrust for this specific thing? What perspectives do I need?

2. THE STRUCTURE: How do I set up the conversation so feedback feels like information, not judgment?

3. THE SEPARATION: How do I make it clear that I own the final decision, so people feel free to be candid?

4. THE QUESTIONS: What specific questions should I ask to surface problems I'm too close to see?

5. THE AFTERMATH: How do I process feedback without getting defensive, and show people their candor was valued?

<calibration>
The magic of the Braintrust: feedback without authority.

TRIGGERS DEFENSE: "You should change the ending"
CREATES REFLECTION: "I wasn't tracking the emotional arc in act two—can you walk me through what you were going for?"

For THE QUESTIONS (section 4), give me 3-5 specific questions, not generic.
Avoid: "What do you think?"
Target: "Where did you get confused?" / "What's the weakest link?" / "If you had to cut one section, which would it be?"

The questions should be hard to answer with "it's great."
</calibration>
```

## 9. Finding the Essential Core
**Pattern by Anne Mulcahy** — Former CEO, Xerox

```
I'm facing a situation where I have more demands than resources. I need to make hard cuts without destroying what matters.

Here's my situation:
[DESCRIBE YOUR CONSTRAINTS AND COMPETING DEMANDS]

Help me think through:

1. THE ESSENTIAL CORE: What's the one thing I do that creates disproportionate value? What would be catastrophic to lose?

2. THE SACRED AND THE EXPENDABLE: What should be protected at all costs? What feels important but is actually expendable?

3. THE CUT LIST: What three specific things should I stop doing? What would I lose, and can I survive that loss?

4. THE MULCAHY TEST: If I had to cut 30% of what I'm doing, what would remain? Is that the 30% I'd actually want to remain?

5. THE REBUILD: Once I've made the cut, what's the first thing to invest in to build back stronger?

<output_guidance>
Mulcahy cut $1.7B in expenses and 25,000 jobs—but never touched R&D. That's triage discipline.

For THE CUT LIST, be specific and honest:
- Name actual things to stop (not "reduce low-value activities")
- Name what you'd lose by stopping them (the real cost)
- Make a clear call: survivable or not

For THE SACRED, the test is: "Would I let other things fail to protect this?" If the answer isn't clearly yes, it's not sacred.

This prompt should hurt a little. If every answer feels comfortable, we're not cutting deep enough.
</output_guidance>
