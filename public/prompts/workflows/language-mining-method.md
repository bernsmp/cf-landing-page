# The Language Mining Method™

*A Systematic Workflow for Extracting Customer Language from Adjacent Domains*

---

### **Pack Overview**

You need customer language but don't have enough reviews, direct access to buyer conversations, budget for formal research, or time to interview prospects. The insight: Your buyers ARE talking about their problem—just not using your words. They're in adjacent communities, reviewing related books, posting in tangential forums—expressing the same pain under different names.

This method extracts that language systematically.

**Perfect for:**
- New offer launches (messaging that resonates before you have testimonials)
- New market entry (language patterns of an unfamiliar audience)
- Sales page rewrites (fresh customer language to replace stale copy)
- Content calendar planning (topics your audience actually cares about)
- Positioning pivots (new language for refined positioning)
- When you're stuck on messaging (been staring at your own copy too long)

**Required materials:**
- Your core problem statement (1-2 sentences)
- Your target buyer description (be specific)
- Known adjacent concepts (if any)
- 30 minutes for complete pipeline

**Outcome:** Customer Language Bible with verbatim quotes, emotional patterns, metaphors, translation dictionaries, and ready-to-use messaging for your specific deliverable.

## **The 5-Phase Language Mining Pipeline**

*Each phase builds on the previous—creating a flowing transformation from problem definition to applied messaging*

---

### **🗺️ Phase 1: Adjacent Territory Mapping**

*"Where does my buyer's pain show up under different names?"*

**[AI-Led, Human Approves]**

**INPUT REQUIRED:**

1. **Your core problem statement** (1-2 sentences)
   - What problem does your offer solve?
   - Example: "Experienced professionals can't articulate what makes them valuable"

2. **Your target buyer** (be specific)
   - Who specifically has this problem?
   - Example: "Consultants with 10+ years experience earning $200K-$500K"

3. **Known adjacent concepts** (if any)
   - What related terms have you heard buyers use?
   - Example: "I've heard them mention imposter syndrome and 'can't scale'"

**PROMPT:**

```
I need to find where my target buyers discuss their problems online—but they won't be using my terminology. Help me map adjacent territories.

MY CORE PROBLEM:
[Paste your problem statement]

MY TARGET BUYER:
[Paste your buyer description]

ADJACENT CONCEPTS I'VE HEARD:
[List any terms you've heard, or write "None yet"]

Please identify:

1. CONCEPTUAL ADJACENCIES
   What academic/professional concepts describe this same problem?
   - Psychology terms
   - Business/management terms
   - Industry-specific jargon
   - Research terminology

2. BOOK ADJACENCIES
   What books do people read when experiencing this problem?
   - Business books
   - Self-help books
   - Industry-specific books
   - Academic texts that crossed over to mainstream

   For each book: Why would my buyer read this? What problem are they trying to solve?

3. COMMUNITY ADJACENCIES
   Where do these people gather online?
   - Relevant subreddits (with estimated size)
   - Industry forums
   - Professional networks (LinkedIn groups, Slack communities)
   - Review sites (G2, Capterra, course platforms)
   - Q&A sites (Quora topics)

4. EMOTIONAL ADJACENCIES
   What emotional states accompany this problem?
   - Frustration patterns
   - Fear patterns
   - Aspiration patterns

   What would someone search when feeling each emotion?

5. FAILURE ADJACENCIES
   What have they probably tried that didn't work?
   - Products/services
   - DIY approaches
   - Advice they've received

   Where would they complain about these failures?

Output as a prioritized research plan:
- Top 5 books to mine reviews from
- Top 5 communities to search
- Top 10 search queries to run
- Top 5 emotional/problem phrases to look for
```

**HUMAN CHECKPOINT:**

Review the AI output and answer:
- [ ] Do these adjacencies feel right? Would my buyer actually be in these places?
- [ ] Are there obvious communities or books missing?
- [ ] Which 3-5 sources should we prioritize first?

Add any adjacencies you know about that AI missed.

---

### **⛏️ Phase 2: Raw Language Mining**

*"What are the exact words real people use?"*

**[AI-Executed]**

**The Key Principle:** We want RAW language—not summaries, not articles about the problem, but actual humans expressing their actual pain in their actual words.

**PROMPT:**

```
Research the following sources to extract raw customer language about [PROBLEM].

SOURCES TO MINE:
[Paste prioritized list from Phase 1]

SPECIFIC SEARCH QUERIES:
[Paste search queries from Phase 1]

For each source, extract:

1. VERBATIM PAIN QUOTES
   - Exact phrases people use to describe the problem
   - Copy word-for-word, including typos and informal language
   - Note the source and context for each

2. EMOTIONAL LANGUAGE PATTERNS
   - Frustration expressions ("I'm so tired of...")
   - Fear expressions ("I keep worrying that...")
   - Shame expressions ("I feel like a fraud when...")
   - Hope expressions ("I just want to...")
   - Relief expressions ("Finally someone who...")

3. METAPHORS AND ANALOGIES
   - How do they visualize the problem?
   - What comparisons do they make?
   - What imagery do they use?

4. QUESTIONS THEY ASK
   - Exact questions posted in forums
   - Questions in book reviews
   - Questions that reveal their mental model

5. FAILED SOLUTIONS MENTIONED
   - What have they tried?
   - Why did it fail?
   - How do they describe the failure?

6. DESIRED OUTCOMES
   - How do they describe "solved"?
   - What would success look like to them?
   - What metrics/timeframes do they mention?

7. OBJECTIONS AND SKEPTICISM
   - What are they skeptical about?
   - What objections do they raise to solutions?
   - What makes them hesitate?

FORMAT EACH FINDING AS:

---
**Quote:** "[Exact verbatim quote]"
**Source:** [Where found - be specific]
**Context:** [What prompted this - thread topic, book being reviewed, etc.]
**Category:** [Pain/Emotion/Metaphor/Question/Failed Solution/Outcome/Objection]
**Usability:** [How/where this could be used in messaging]
---

Prioritize:
- Quotes with strong emotional charge
- Metaphors that are vivid and specific
- Questions that reveal misunderstandings
- Failures that your solution actually addresses

Minimum extraction: 30 distinct quotes across categories
```

**QUALITY CHECK:**

The AI should return quotes that feel:
- **Raw** (not polished marketing language)
- **Specific** (not generic platitudes)
- **Emotional** (you can feel the frustration/fear/hope)
- **Attributable** (you know exactly where it came from)

If the quotes feel generic, push back: "These feel too polished. Find rawer, more emotional expressions."

---

### **🔬 Phase 3: Pattern Synthesis**

*"What surprised me? What confirmed? What's missing?"*

**[AI-Led, Human Validates]**

**The Key Questions:** This phase is driven by three questions that force actual thinking:
1. What surprised me? (Counterintuitive findings)
2. What confirmed what I already believed? (Validation)
3. What's missing that I expected to find? (Gaps)

**PROMPT:**

```
Analyze the language mining results and synthesize patterns.

RAW DATA:
[Paste all quotes and findings from Phase 2]

MY INITIAL HYPOTHESES ABOUT THIS AUDIENCE:
[What did you believe about their pain before this research?]

Analyze and report:

1. THREE THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME
   For each:
   - What the finding was
   - Why it's counterintuitive
   - What it means for messaging
   - Specific quotes that prove it

2. THREE THINGS THAT CONFIRMED
   For each:
   - What was validated
   - How strong the evidence is
   - How to leverage this confirmation
   - Specific quotes that prove it

3. THREE GAPS OR MISSING ELEMENTS
   For each:
   - What I expected to find but didn't
   - Possible reasons it's missing
   - Whether to investigate further or let it go

4. DOMINANT EMOTIONAL PATTERNS
   - Primary emotion (what most people feel)
   - Secondary emotion (what underlies the primary)
   - Trigger moments (what activates the emotion)
   - Language clusters around each emotion

5. THE MISDIAGNOSIS PATTERN
   - What do they THINK their problem is?
   - What is their problem ACTUALLY?
   - Why do they miss the real problem?
   - How does your solution address the real problem?

6. THE LANGUAGE TRANSLATION TABLE
   | What They Say | What It Means | Your Term For It |
   |---------------|---------------|------------------|
   [Map their vocabulary to your concepts]

7. THE "NOBODY IS SAYING THIS" OPPORTUNITY
   - What truth exists that no one is articulating?
   - What would be surprising/relieving for them to hear?
   - How could you own this message?
```

**HUMAN CHECKPOINT:**

Review synthesis and validate:
- [ ] Do the surprises actually surprise YOU? (If not, dig deeper)
- [ ] Does the misdiagnosis pattern ring true to your experience?
- [ ] Is there a "nobody is saying this" insight that feels ownable?

Add your own observations:
- What patterns do you see that AI missed?
- What connects to your direct experience with clients?
- What contradicts what you've heard firsthand?

---

## **Quality Standards**

### Good Language Mining Looks Like:

✓ Quotes feel raw and unpolished
✓ You can feel the emotion in the words
✓ Sources are specific and traceable
✓ Mix of pain, hope, and frustration
✓ Metaphors are vivid and specific
✓ Questions reveal their mental model
✓ You're surprised by at least one finding

### Bad Language Mining Looks Like:

✗ Quotes sound like marketing copy
✗ Everything confirms what you already believed
✗ Sources are vague ("from a forum")
✗ All pain, no hope or aspiration
✗ Generic phrases anyone could say
✗ No emotional charge
✗ Nothing surprising

---

## **Maintenance & Updates**

### When to Re-Run This Process

- Every 6-12 months (language evolves)
- When entering a new market segment
- When a major competitor emerges
- When conversion rates drop
- When you notice your copy feeling stale
- After a positioning pivot

### How to Build on Previous Mining

Each time you run this:
1. Start with your existing Customer Language Bible
2. Look for what's changed or new
3. Add new findings, don't replace
4. Note date of each mining session
5. Track which quotes have been "used up" in content
