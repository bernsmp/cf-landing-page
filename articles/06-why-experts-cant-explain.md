# Why Experts Can't Explain What They Do (And What Actually Works Instead)

*Last updated: January 2025*

---

**Experts can't explain what they do because expertise restructures how knowledge is stored in the brain.** Through years of practice, explicit step-by-step knowledge becomes "compiled" into rapid pattern-matching that operates below conscious awareness. This isn't a communication failure. It's a neurological feature of mastery. The brain optimizes for performance by making knowledge automatic, which simultaneously makes it inaccessible to verbal explanation.

Cognitive psychologists Chase and Simon demonstrated that chess experts perceive board positions as meaningful "chunks" rather than individual pieces. They literally see the game differently and can't access the pattern-recognition processes that inform their moves (Source: Chase & Simon, "Perception in Chess," 1973). Studies on expert-novice differences show that experts skip steps when explaining tasks because those steps have been "proceduralized," compiled into unconscious routines that bypass working memory (Source: John Anderson, ACT-R cognitive architecture research). The "illusion of explanatory depth" research shows that experts believe they understand their own processes better than they actually do. When asked to explain in detail, they discover gaps they didn't know existed (Source: Rozenblit & Keil, Yale University, 2002).

This is the part I find fascinating: the same brain optimization that makes you excellent prevents you from seeing how you're excellent.

## The Real Reason Experts Struggle to Explain

If you've struggled to articulate what makes you good at what you do, let me start with some good news.

This has nothing to do with character flaws. Nothing to do with communication deficits. Nothing to do with arrogance or unwillingness to share.

This is how the brain handles expert-level knowledge.

Understanding this removes shame and points to solutions. You're not failing to explain. You're experiencing a neurological limitation that affects every expert in every field.

Your brain faces a tradeoff: optimize for DOING or optimize for EXPLAINING. It can't do both. To perform at expert level, the brain must automate knowledge. Automation means removing it from conscious access.

This is good news and bad news. The good news: you're actually expert. The bad news: you can't see how.

## How Expertise Restructures the Brain

Three things happen as you develop expertise. Each one makes you better at performing and worse at explaining.

### Chunking: Experts See Differently

Novices see individual elements. Experts see meaningful patterns.

A chess grandmaster doesn't see 32 pieces on 64 squares. They see "a weak king position" or "the Sicilian Defense." These are chunks, compressed patterns that carry meaning.

A consultant doesn't see 15 separate symptoms in a struggling business. They see "a leadership vacuum" or "strategy-execution disconnect." Same phenomenon.

These chunks are powerful. They let you process information faster than conscious analysis would allow. They're also invisible. You can't see yourself chunking because the chunks happen instantaneously.

### Proceduralization: Knowledge Goes Underground

Repeated practice "compiles" knowledge. Conscious steps become automatic routines.

Think of keyboard shortcuts replacing manual clicks. At first, you had to think: File menu, then Save. Now you hit Command-S without thinking about what Command-S does.

Professional expertise works the same way. Steps that once required deliberate attention now happen without conscious involvement. You can't "undo" the compilation to see the original steps. The compilation is permanent.

### Automaticity: The Performance-Explanation Tradeoff

Peak performance requires automatic execution. Automatic execution means you're not conscious of steps. Consciousness would actually slow you down.

So the brain hides the steps from you. On purpose.

Athletes call this "flow state" or "the zone." You're performing at your highest level precisely because you're not thinking about what you're doing. Your conscious mind would get in the way.

The same thing happens in knowledge work. Your best client conversations happen when you're not thinking about technique. Your best strategic insights come without deliberate reasoning.

The cost: you can't explain what you just did.

## The Three Ways This Shows Up

Understanding the neuroscience is useful. But recognizing the phenomenon in your own experience is more practical.

### The Vanishing Steps Problem

You explain your process in five steps. But you actually do fifteen things. Ten steps have become invisible to you.

Learners fail because they're missing two-thirds of the picture. You get frustrated because they "didn't follow instructions." They get frustrated because the instructions were incomplete.

A sales leader explains: "Just build rapport, identify needs, present solutions." But video analysis of her calls reveals dozens of micro-adjustments, question patterns, and timing decisions she never mentions. She doesn't see herself doing them. They've vanished from conscious awareness.

### The "It Depends" Problem

Asked how you handle a situation, you say "it depends." You're not being evasive. You genuinely can't access the decision rules.

The rules exist. Your behavior is consistent. Analysis of fifty similar situations would reveal a clear pattern.

But you can't see the pattern from inside. "It depends" is the honest answer when your brain has hidden its own logic.

A consultant is asked: "How do you know when a client is ready to buy?" Answer: "It depends on the situation." But analysis of his client interactions reveals specific cues he consistently responds to. A pattern invisible to him, obvious in the data.

### The Post-Rationalization Problem

When pushed to explain, you create logical-sounding reasons. These explanations often don't match what you actually do.

You're not lying. You're pattern-matching to expected explanations. Your brain needs a reason, so it constructs one after the fact.

This is why written processes don't transfer expertise. The processes capture your rationalization of what you do, not your actual behavior.

An executive explains her strategic decisions as based on "market data analysis." But observation shows she often decides before seeing data, then uses data to validate. Her real process is intuition that she's learned to rationalize.

## Why Traditional Solutions Fail

Experts typically try four things. All four have structural limitations.

**"Just document it" doesn't work.** You can only document what you're conscious of. The 80-90% that's tacit never makes it onto the page. Result: SOPs that produce mediocre results.

**"Just explain it step by step" doesn't work.** You'll skip steps you don't see yourself taking. You'll include steps that aren't actually critical. You'll post-rationalize rather than accurately describe.

**"Just train people" doesn't work.** You'll assume knowledge that learners don't have. You'll move too fast because the steps feel obvious. You'll get frustrated when they "don't get it."

**"Just watch me" partially works.** Observation captures behavior but not cognition. Learners see WHAT but not WHY. Without the mental model, they can't adapt to new situations.

Each method fails for the same reason: it relies on the expert's conscious access to knowledge that has become unconscious.

## What Actually Makes Expertise Visible

Trying harder to explain won't solve this. Being "more articulate" won't either. The method of knowledge capture needs to change entirely.

### Analysis Over Introspection

Don't ask experts what they do. Analyze what they actually do across many instances. Look for patterns they can't see themselves.

This is where AI-powered analysis changes the equation. The technology to examine hundreds of hours of someone's actual work, finding patterns across all of it, didn't exist until recently. What would take human analysts months, AI surfaces in weeks.

### Behavior Over Explanation

Study transcripts, decisions, outputs. Compare across multiple similar situations. Let patterns emerge from data, not self-report.

When you analyze what someone actually says and does rather than what they think they say and do, the gap is often dramatic. The patterns that emerge are patterns they've never consciously recognized.

### External Observer Over Self-Reflection

You can't see your own blind spots. Someone outside your expertise can see what you take for granted.

They ask "why did you do that?" when you don't realize you did anything. They notice the pause, the word choice, the timing that's become invisible to you.

This is why methodology extraction works. Instead of asking you to explain your expertise (which you can't), AI-powered analysis examines your actual work across many client interactions. Patterns that are invisible to you become visible to external analysis.

## What This Means for Your Career

The inability to explain your expertise has practical consequences. Understanding them helps you decide what to do.

### If You're Trying to Scale

Your inability to explain is blocking your growth. You can't create courses, train others, or license your approach.

Until the tacit becomes explicit, you're stuck at personal capacity.

### If You're Building a Team

Your team won't replicate your results through observation alone. Critical knowledge is leaving with your attention.

You need to extract what makes you effective, in a form others can actually use.

### If You Want to Differentiate

"I'm good at what I do" isn't a positioning statement. Visible methodology is more valuable than invisible expertise.

Named frameworks command premium prices. Invisible excellence doesn't.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why can't I articulate my expertise?
Your expertise has been "compiled" by your brain into unconscious pattern-matching. Through years of practice, step-by-step knowledge becomes automatic, which makes it inaccessible to verbal recall. This is normal for all experts. It's a feature of mastery, not a personal failing.

### Is this why I'm a bad teacher?
You're not a "bad teacher." You're experiencing a neurological limitation that affects all experts. You skip steps you don't know you're taking and assume knowledge that feels obvious to you but isn't to learners. Understanding this can help you improve, but truly transferring tacit knowledge often requires external extraction methods.

### Can I train myself to explain better?
Partially. You can learn to slow down and be more deliberate. But you can't access knowledge that your brain has automated below conscious awareness. "Try harder to explain" misses the point. AI-powered methods that analyze your behavior work because they don't rely on your self-report.

### Why do my written processes not work for others?
Because your processes capture only the 10-20% of your expertise that's explicit. The other 80-90%, the pattern recognition, judgment calls, and micro-adjustments, stays in your head. Followers of your written process get your skeleton, not your full capability.

### How is this different from the curse of knowledge?
They're related. The "curse of knowledge" is knowing something so well you can't imagine not knowing it, leading to communication gaps. The "can't explain" problem is specifically about expert knowledge being stored in unconscious pattern-matching. The curse of knowledge makes you assume others know what you know. The expertise problem means you genuinely can't access what you know.

## The Problem Was Never You. Expertise Works This Way.

If you've struggled to explain what makes you good at what you do, that struggle points to neurological reality, not communication failure. Mastery has a cost: invisibility. External analysis reveals patterns you can't see yourself.

Your expertise has been doing its job quietly for years. It's ready to be introduced to you properly. It's just waiting for someone else to make the introduction.
