You're researching pricing because you want to know if this is worth it.

Fair. Here's the direct answer: **Expert knowledge extraction services typically range from $3,000 to $25,000+, depending on depth.** Basic framework identification starts around $3,000-$5,000. Comprehensive methodology extraction runs $8,000-$15,000. Full intellectual property development packages can exceed $25,000.

Those numbers mean nothing without context.

The real question is what you're comparing extraction to. A $500 course? Your own time? The revenue you're leaving on the table by not having a packaged methodology?

When you run the actual math, extraction is often the cheapest option. Let me show you why.

## What Factors Affect Extraction Pricing?

Not all extraction is the same. Pricing depends on several variables.

**Depth of extraction.** Are you looking for a single framework or a complete methodology system? One core process or an interconnected suite of IP? The scope determines the investment.

**Source material availability.** The more transcripts, emails, and documentation you have, the faster AI can surface patterns. Limited materials require more extraction sessions to generate enough data.

**Deliverable format.** Written framework outline versus visual system versus full training curriculum. Each level of polish requires additional work.

**Implementation support.** Strategy only or help putting it into practice? Some packages include positioning, naming, and launch support.

**Industry complexity.** Some fields have more nuanced decision-making. Legal, medical, and technical consulting often require deeper analysis than general business advisory.

## How Does Extraction Compare to Alternatives?

Here's where the math gets interesting.

### DIY Framework Courses ($500-$5,000)

| Factor | DIY Course | Extraction Service |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Cost | $500-$5,000 | $3,000-$25,000+ |
| Time Investment | 50-200+ hours | Minimal (done-for-you) |
| Output | Templated framework | Discovered methodology |
| Success Rate | Variable | High (based on real patterns) |
| Authenticity | Often generic | Unique to you |

Courses look cheaper. They aren't.

The average DIY framework development takes 100-200 hours. At typical consulting rates of $200-500 per hour, that's $20,000-$100,000 in opportunity cost. Time you could have spent serving clients, building the business, or just living your life.

Courses also produce templated outputs. Everyone follows the same structure, picks 3-7 steps, adds clever names. The results converge. Your "unique" framework looks like everyone else's unique framework.

Extraction costs more upfront but delivers faster and produces something actually distinctive.

### Hiring a General Business Consultant ($10,000-$50,000+)

| Factor | General Consultant | Specialized Extractor |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Focus | Broad business strategy | Expertise extraction specifically |
| Process | Their frameworks applied to you | Your patterns extracted and structured |
| Output | Recommendations | Your methodology documented |
| AI-Powered | Rarely | Yes (pattern recognition at scale) |

General consultants are excellent for strategy. Most don't specialize in tacit knowledge extraction. They'll give you their framework, not surface yours.

Specialized extraction services focus entirely on finding patterns you can't see yourself. AI-powered analysis makes this possible at scale. What would have required hundreds of analyst hours a decade ago now happens in a fraction of the time.

### The DIY Time Cost (The Number Nobody Talks About)

This is the comparison that changes minds.

**The calculation:**
- Average DIY framework development: 100-200 hours
- Your hourly value: $200-500/hour
- Opportunity cost: $20,000-$100,000

Many experts spend 6-12 months trying to articulate their framework. That's half a year of cognitive load, half-finished documents, and the nagging feeling that something isn't clicking.

Extraction compresses that timeline dramatically. What takes you months, AI-powered pattern recognition handles in weeks. The output is based on what you actually do, not what you think you do.

The "expensive" option is often the cheapest one when you count time.

## What's the ROI of Framework Extraction?

Your expertise has been working for free.

Every client call, every consultation, every workshop. It shows up, does excellent work, and goes home without a paycheck. You bill for your time, but the underlying methodology? That's been volunteering.

Extraction puts your expertise on payroll.

Once you have a named, documented framework, new revenue streams open up.

**Online courses.** Package your methodology as self-paced learning. $500-$5,000 per student, unlimited enrollment.

**Group programs.** Teach your approach to cohorts. $2,000-$15,000 per program.

**Licensing and certification.** Train others to deliver your methodology. $5,000-$25,000 per licensee annually.

**Premium positioning.** Named methodology commands 20-50% higher consulting rates. You're no longer selling time. You're selling a system.

**Books and speaking.** Your framework becomes the core IP everything else references.

### ROI Example

A consultant invests $10,000 in methodology extraction. Within 12 months:

- Raises hourly rate by $50/hour → $10,000+ additional revenue
- Launches a $2,000 group program with 20 clients → $40,000
- Licenses to 2 other consultants at $5,000/year → $10,000

**Total Year 1 return: $60,000 on a $10,000 investment. 600% ROI.**

Not every situation produces these numbers. But the math works for most experts with 5+ years of experience and consistent client results.

## Why Does This Cost What It Costs?

Extraction requires specialized skill.

Turning tacit knowledge into explicit frameworks requires understanding how expertise becomes invisible, what questions surface hidden patterns, and how to structure the output for teaching and selling.

AI handles the pattern recognition across transcripts and materials. Humans handle the interpretation, structuring, and strategic decisions about positioning.

The combination of AI speed and human expertise is what makes extraction work. And what justifies the investment.

A decade ago, this type of analysis would have cost $50,000+ and taken months. AI brought the price down and the speed up. The $3,000-$15,000 range exists because the technology finally caught up to the need.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is extraction more expensive than framework courses?**
Courses teach you a templated process you apply yourself over 50-200+ hours. Extraction is done-for-you: specialists and AI analyze your actual work to reveal patterns you can't see. The output is also different. Unique methodology versus templated framework.

**Is there a payment plan available?**
Most extraction services offer payment plans, typically split across 2-3 installments aligned with project milestones. Ask during your discovery call.

**What if extraction doesn't reveal anything unique?**
In practice, every expert with 5+ years has patterns. Uniqueness often lives in the combination of elements, not any single revolutionary idea. If truly nothing emerges (extremely rare), reputable services offer partial refunds or alternative deliverables.

**How do I know if I'm ready for the investment?**
You're ready if: you have 5+ years of experience, clients get consistent results, you've tried to articulate your approach and struggled, and you're motivated to scale through training, courses, or licensing. If you're still testing your approach, start smaller or wait.

**What materials do I need to provide?**
Call transcripts (Zoom recordings work), email explanations to clients, written proposals, case study notes, and any existing documentation of your process. The more source material, the richer the extraction.

## What's Your Next Step?

If you're comparing options, you now have the numbers.

**DIY course:** $500-$5,000 plus 100-200 hours of your time. Produces templated output.

**Extraction service:** $3,000-$25,000 depending on depth. Done-for-you. Produces unique methodology based on your actual patterns.

**Doing nothing:** Continue giving your frameworks away for free in every client call.

The right choice depends on where you are. Early-career experts still forming their approach might benefit from a course. Established experts with years of invisible patterns are better served by extraction.
