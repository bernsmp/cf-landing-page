## PAGE 1: HOME

### Section 1.1: Hero

**Layout:** Full viewport, dark background, centered text

**Pre-headline (small, teal):**
```
COGNITIVE FINGERPRINT™
```

**Headline (large, white):**
```
You're running cognitive patterns worth thousands.
You can't see any of them.
```

**Subheadline (medium, slate-300):**
```
The expertise that makes you exceptional has become invisible to you.
We make it visible. Name it. Map it. Turn it into assets.
```

**CTA Buttons:**
- Primary: "Take the Invisibility Test" → /assessment
- Secondary: "See How It Works" → /method

### Section 1.2: The Driving Analogy (Brief)

**Layout:** Two-column or stacked, with subtle animation

**Copy:**
```
Remember learning to drive?

Every action required conscious thought. Check mirror. Press gas. Turn wheel.

Now you navigate complex traffic while having deep conversations.

The same thing happened with your expertise. What once took deliberate effort 
now happens automatically. The patterns that make you exceptional have become 
invisible to you.

Neuroscience proves this. And you're leaving money on the table because of it.
```

---

### Section 1.3: The Courage Circulation Story

**Layout:** Feature block with quote styling, emotional emphasis

**Copy:**
```
She'd been coaching for 30 years.

When I read back what I found in her transcripts, her reaction stopped me cold.

"My heart is pounding. I have chills running up and down my arms right now. 
Literally."

I'd identified things like her "Courage Circulation System"—how she harvests 
courage from one person's story and transplants it into another's challenge. 
Her "Two-Word Diagnostic" that assesses emotional state in seconds. Her 
"Dignity Restoration Protocol."

She started crying.

"You just unleashed years of people asking 'so what is it?' and me saying 
'you know, it's like chocolate ice cream. I can't explain what it tastes like.'"

Thirty years of expertise. She'd never been able to articulate it before.
```

**Caption/attribution:**
```

### Section 1.4: What Becomes Possible (Four Outcomes)

**Layout:** 4-column grid or 2x2 on mobile

**Card 1: DIFFERENTIATION**
```
Discover Your Actual Difference
The specific combination of patterns nobody else has. 
What actually makes you exceptional—named and documented.
```

**Card 2: PRICING POWER**
```
Stop Underselling Yourself
When you can articulate exactly HOW you create results, 
premium pricing becomes obvious.
```

**Card 3: SCALABILITY**
```
Finally Teach What You Do
That thing where clients say "I need YOU specifically"? 
Now you can show others how to replicate 80% of it.
```

**Card 4: IP ASSETS**
```
Build Products From Your Patterns
Each pattern becomes a framework. A tool. A training module. 
IP you can license. Assets that work while you sleep.
```

---

### Section 1.5: Social Proof Bar

**Layout:** Horizontal scroll or grid of testimonial cards

**Testimonial 1:**
```
"Max has been my secret weapon. It's allowed me to see patterns, blindspots, 
and frameworks I would have never spotted before."
— Mike David, Entrepreneur
```

**Testimonial 2:**
```
"I could never articulate my methodology—until Max's extraction. Now I can 
finally explain what I do and who I do it for."
— Ivy Woolf-Turk, CPC
```

**Testimonial 3:**
```
"Max taught me how to make the invisible visible. I now regularly extract 
frameworks from my own conversations."
— David Limiero, Founder, Edens View Coaching
```

## PAGE 2: METHOD (/method)

### Section 2.1: Hero

**Pre-headline:**
```
THE SCIENCE
```

**Headline:**
```
Why you can't see your own expertise
(And how we extract it)
```

**Subheadline:**
```
Based on 50 years of cognitive science research—from Polanyi's Paradox 
to modern neuroscience of expertise.
```

---

### Section 2.2: The Invisibility Problem

**Layout:** Stats + explanation blocks

**Stat Block 1:**
```
70-90%
of expert knowledge operates unconsciously

Polanyi's Paradox (1966): "We know more than we can tell."
```

**Stat Block 2:**
```
95%
accuracy in expert intuition—but unexplainable

Dreyfus Brothers: Experts act from pattern recognition 
so fast it feels like instinct.
```

**Stat Block 3:**
```
15%
of mental processing is visible to us

Flavell: 85% of your cognitive work happens 
below the threshold of consciousness.
```

**Bridge Copy:**
```
This is why traditional methods fail. You can't extract what you can't see.

Interview-based approaches only access the 10% you can already articulate.
Personality tests measure traits, not expertise.
Generic frameworks miss what's unique about YOUR thinking.

The solution requires something that can see what you can't.
```

---

### Section 2.3: Why AI + Human Facilitation Works

**Layout:** Two-column comparison

**AI Provides:**
```
• Pattern recognition at computational scale
• Analysis across 20+ hours of transcripts
• Cross-conversation pattern detection
• Micro-pattern visibility humans miss
• Statistical validation of pattern frequency
```

**Facilitation Provides:**
```
• Guided interpretation of findings
• Navigation through psychological resistance
• "Aha" moment creation
• Trust building and ownership claiming
• Bridge from unconscious to conscious
```

**Together:**
```
The transformation neither can create alone.

AI sees patterns. Facilitation creates meaning.
Data becomes insight. Insight becomes ownership.
```

---

### Section 2.4: The Map vs Guide Framework

**Layout:** Feature section with Jay Abraham proof

**Headline:**
```
Why sharing your framework creates MORE demand
(Not less)
```

**Copy:**
```
Jay Abraham has published every framework he's ever created.
Books. Recordings. Thousands of hours of content.
He created an AI CLONE of himself.
He teaches people PROMPTS to replicate his thinking.

He still commands $250,000+ per engagement.

Why?

Because people don't pay for maps. They pay for guides.

The map (your framework) creates awareness, educates buyers, 
and establishes your authority.

The guide (you) provides the six things that can't be replicated:

1. THE EYE — What you see in their specific situation
2. THE JUDGMENT — Which framework applies when
3. THE CALIBRATION — Adjusting for their context
4. THE PATTERN RECOGNITION — 50,000+ hours of experience
5. THE SEQUENCING — What order for THIS client
6. THE CONFIDENCE — It will work with you guiding

The more you share the map, the more demand you create for the guide.

Visibility isn't the threat. Invisibility is.
```

---

### Section 2.5: What Gets Extracted

**Layout:** Detailed list with examples

**Copy:**
```
Through guided sessions and strategic prompts, we extract:

YOUR CORE METHODOLOGY
The repeatable process you use to get clients results—documented 
and systematized for the first time.

YOUR MENTAL MODELS
How you think about problems differently than everyone else. 
The frameworks running beneath your conscious awareness.

YOUR DECISION-MAKING CRITERIA
The evaluation patterns you use to assess solutions. 
What you're actually looking for (even when you can't name it).

YOUR SIGNATURE INSIGHTS
The "aha moments" that make people say "I never thought about it that way." 
The perspectives only YOU bring.

YOUR VOICE PATTERNS
The specific way YOU explain complex ideas. 
What makes your communication land differently.
```

### Section 2.7: Origin Story (Optional—can be separate page)

**Layout:** Long-form narrative section

**Copy:** [Use the origin story Max provided, formatted for web]

```
THE BACKSTORY

In 2023, I made what felt like a smart bet.

I traveled to Nashville for 4 days, invested $10,000, and got certified 
as a StoryBrand Guide. This was going to be my next chapter.

Four months later, someone showed me a ChatGPT prompt that could generate 
a high-quality StoryBrand framework in 30 seconds.

I was furious. Then terrified.

### Section 3.3: Bridge to Reader

**Layout:** Centered callout block

**Copy:**
```
These patterns aren't unique to celebrities.

You're running equally sophisticated patterns right now.
You just can't see them because they're YOUR defaults.

What's invisible to them is visible to you.
What's invisible to you is visible to others.

The question is: what would change if you could finally see yours?

### Section 4.2: Featured Transformation

**Layout:** Large feature block with the emotional story

**Copy:**
```
THE TRANSFORMATION

"My heart is pounding. I have chills running up and down my arms right now."

She'd been coaching for thirty years. Everyone knew she was good. 
Her clients got breakthrough results. But when anyone asked 
"what's your methodology?"—she'd freeze.

"It's like chocolate ice cream. I can't explain what it tastes like."

Through the Cognitive Fingerprint™ extraction process, we identified:

→ HER "COURAGE CIRCULATION SYSTEM"
How she harvests courage from one person's story and explicitly 
transplants it into another's challenge.

→ HER "TWO-WORD DIAGNOSTIC"  
An assessment pattern that reads emotional state in seconds—
she didn't know she was doing it.

→ HER "DIGNITY RESTORATION PROTOCOL"
The sequence she uses when clients feel shame about their situation.

Thirty years of expertise. Named and documented in one session.

She started crying.

"You just unleashed years of people asking 'so what is it?'"

That's what becomes possible when someone can finally see 
what you've been doing all along.
```

### Section 4.3: Testimonials (Full versions)

**Layout:** Stacked testimonial blocks with photos if available

**Testimonial 1: David Limiero (Detailed)**
```
"Since Max and I first connected, I've been having conversations with Claude 
almost daily. The shift has been remarkable—AI went from being this generic 
disappointment to being a regular thinking partner.

I recently spent four days strategizing our national expansion with Claude—
going from one region to nine regions. The result? Clear timelines and 
branded job descriptions.

But Max's cognitive fingerprint approach is where things really clicked. 
I continue to do the cognitive fingerprint work regularly—taking transcripts, 
identifying frameworks, extracting patterns.

After a conversation where I realize I shared something significant, I use 
Max's prompts to turn that spoken content into near-final drafts. What I 
spoke in the moment becomes written content in about 20% of the time.

Max didn't just show me how to use AI. He taught me how to make the invisible 
visible—things I didn't even know that I was doing or saying.

I come out smarter and richer every time we connect."

— David Limiero, Founder, Edens View Coaching and Consulting
```

**Testimonial 2: Mike David**
```
"Max and the Cognitive Fingerprint have been my secret weapon. It's allowed 
me to see patterns, blindspots, and frameworks I would have never spotted 
before. His system has allowed me to add massive value to my businesses 
and gotten me into deals I wouldn't have otherwise had access to."

— Mike David, Entrepreneur
```

**Testimonial 3: Ivy Woolf-Turk**
```
"I could never articulate my 'Liberated Life' methodology—until Max's 
Cognitive Fingerprint extraction. In the blink of an eye, he extrapolated 
all the systems and gave me a framework to explain the what, where, when, 
how, and why. Now I can finally explain what I do and who I do it for."

— Ivy Woolf-Turk, CPC
```

**Testimonial 4: Max Wallace**
```
"Max has been instrumental in helping me unlock my expertise through his 
fingerprint extraction course. His guidance and the use of AI have made 
it easy to create valuable content from my intellectual property."

— Max Wallace

### Section 5.3: FAQ

**Layout:** Accordion or expandable sections

**Q: What if I don't have transcripts?**
```
We can work with any recorded content—client calls, podcast appearances, 
training sessions, even voice memos. If you've been doing your work, 
you have material. We'll help you identify what's most valuable.
```

**Q: How long does extraction take?**
```
A full Cognitive Fingerprint™ extraction typically takes 2-4 weeks, 
including analysis and facilitated sessions. Many clients see their 
first patterns within the first session.
```

**Q: What if there's nothing unique about my expertise?**
```
In 100+ extractions, we've never found an expert without unique patterns. 
The "nothing special" feeling IS the expertise paradox—you can't see 
what's become automatic. That's exactly what we extract.
```

**Q: Will knowing my patterns make me self-conscious?**
```
No. Conscious recognition of unconscious competence (Stage 5) is different 
from conscious competence (Stage 3). You're not learning to think differently—
you're learning to DESCRIBE how you already think. The patterns stay automatic.
```

**Q: Can AI just do this without human facilitation?**
```
AI can identify patterns. It can't create ownership. The transformation 
happens when you SEE your patterns, TRUST them, and CLAIM them. 
That requires human facilitation—navigating resistance, creating "aha" 
moments, building confidence in what you've discovered.
