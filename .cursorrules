# Deployment Troubleshooting Rules

## CRITICAL: Always Check Git Status First

When debugging deployment issues (especially "changes not showing on Vercel"), **ALWAYS run `git status` FIRST** before:
- Debugging build errors
- Checking Vercel configuration
- Force deploying
- Investigating TypeScript errors

## The Pattern

**User says:** "My changes aren't showing on production" or "It works locally but not deployed"

**Your first action:** `git status`

**Most common cause:** Uncommitted changes (90% of cases)

**Solution:** Commit and push changes, then wait for Vercel auto-deploy

## Workflow

1. `git status` - Check for uncommitted changes
2. `git diff` - See what changed (if uncommitted changes found)
3. `git add <files> && git commit -m "..." && git push` - Commit and push
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for Vercel auto-deploy
5. Only then check build logs if still not working

## Red Flags

If user mentions:
- "Works locally but not production"
- "Changes not showing up"
- "Site looks different locally vs deployed"

→ Check `git status` immediately
