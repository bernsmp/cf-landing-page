# Add Language Mining Method Workflow

## Plan

- [ ] Create the markdown file at `/public/prompts/workflows/language-mining-method.md`
- [ ] Add the workflow entry to `data/prompts.ts` with proper structure (5 steps based on the five phases)
- [ ] Test the build to ensure no errors

## Details

The workflow has 5 phases:
1. Adjacent Territory Mapping - AI-Led, Human Approves
2. Raw Language Mining - AI-Executed
3. Pattern Synthesis - AI-Led, Human Validates
4. Knowledge Asset Creation - AI Proposes, Human Selects
5. Immediate Application - AI Drafts, Human Refines

Category: `extraction` (since it extracts customer language from adjacent domains)
Estimated time: 2-4 hours (based on the document)
Premium: true (complex multi-step workflow)
